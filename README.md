A deep learning project that classifies flower images into various categories such as Daisy, Dandelion, Rose, Sunflower, and Tulip using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) built with TensorFlow/Keras.

Technologies Used:
- Python
- TensorFlow / Keras
- OpenCV
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Jupyter Notebook

What It Does:
It takes an image of a flower as input.
Preprocesses the image (resizing, normalization).
Feeds it into a trained CNN model.
Outputs the predicted flower category with high accuracy.

Core Components:
A dataset of flower images (manually or publicly sourced).
CNN architecture built and trained using TensorFlow/Keras.
Jupyter notebooks for model training and testing.
Exported model files (.h5, .json) for deployment or reuse.
A collection of test images for real-world validation.

Results: The model performs well on validation and test images, accurately predicting flower categories across multiple test cases.
